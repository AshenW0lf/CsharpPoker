# CsharpPoker

This project is the tutorial on functional programming as found in https://edcharbeneau.com/csharp-functional-workshop-instructions/.

The project has altered the way the unit tests run to make use of AutoFixture features like `AutoData` to populate a unit tests data.  
FluentAssertions are also made use of instead of `Assert` statements.
